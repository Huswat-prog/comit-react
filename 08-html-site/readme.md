# Lesson 08 - HTML Site

We've covered the foundational concepts of HTML over the past few lessons. Let's take this time to put everything together and build a multiple page website for yourself. It will look pretty plain but once we get into styling we will come back to this same code and make it prettier!

# Exercise Instructions

We're going to build a fake website for you that contains a home page, an about page, and a contact page with a form.

Every page should have:

- A `<header>` with the title `<Your Name>'s Portfolio`
- A `<nav>` with a link to each page
- A document `<title>`

- Create a home page, `index.html`
  - todo
- Create an about page, `about.html`
  - todo
- Create a contact page, `contact.html`
  - todo

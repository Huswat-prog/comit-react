# Lesson 09 - CSS Style Attribute

Up until now, our websites have been very plain. The reason for this is that it's important to understand the _why_ of everything. Why we use HTML. Why we use CSS. If we introduce all of these concepts at once, lines start to get blurred over what technology does what.

As we learn CSS, we will work our way up from the least efficient, to the most efficient ways of accomplishing things while also learning all of the rules.

To begin we'll take a look at the `style` attribute that can be applied to any HTML tag.

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

We've learned that HTML builds the content of our web page, but does how do we spice it up? Enter CSS. CSS consists of 3 main things:

- A selector - which element are we applying these styles to
- A property (often referred to as `rules`) - what kind of style are we applying
- A value - the value we assign to the property

Here's what it would look like to change the text color and size of an `<h1>`

```html
<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 32px">My Website</h1>
```

By using the `style` attribute we can directly set `property: value` styles on the element (and set multiple by separating it by a semi-colon `;`).

Every property has different kinds of values that it can take in. In our example above:

- `color` - possible values
  - A [keyword color](todo), e.g. `blue` or `red`
  - A [hexidecimal](todo), e.g. `#00FF00`
